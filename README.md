**'Looking to Learn Every Day'**

I'm a Data Science Student at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. The projects I put on this profile were made with the intent to learn more about software development and Data Science. I have a huge interest in machine learning and with what I learn from these projects to get a job in the sector. Thanks for looking!
